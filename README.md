# Network Scanner Web Application

This project is a Flask-based web application that performs network scans using the Nmap library. Users can initiate various types of network scans on a specified IP address, and the app provides feedback on scan progress, results, and possible vulnerabilities. It is ideal for network administrators, penetration testers, and cybersecurity enthusiasts.

## Features

- **Multiple Scan Types**: Supports different types of scans, including TCP SYN Scan, TCP Connect Scan, UDP Scan, TCP ACK Scan, TCP Window Scan, TCP Null Scan, TCP FIN Scan, TCP Xmas Tree Scan, Version Detection, and OS Detection.
- **Host Discovery**: Checks if a host is reachable before proceeding with scans.
- **Real-Time Progress Tracking**: Displays progress updates in real-time while the scan is ongoing.
- **Scan Results**: Displays open ports and identifies possible vulnerabilities based on common CVEs (for demonstration purposes).
- **Asynchronous Scanning**: Uses threading to manage scan progress without blocking the web interface.

## Prerequisites

- **Python**: Make sure Python 3.x is installed.
- **Flask**: Install Flask with `pip install flask`.
- **Nmap**: Install the Nmap library for Python with `pip install python-nmap`.
- **Nmap Command Line Tool**: Ensure Nmap is installed on your system.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-scanner-web-app.git
   cd network-scanner-web-app
   ```


2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. Open a browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to access the app.

## Usage

1. Enter the IP address you want to scan in the provided input field.
2. Select the scan types you'd like to perform from the list.
3. Submit the form to start the scan.
4. View the scan progress, results, and potential vulnerabilities on the results page.
